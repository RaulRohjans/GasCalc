This is an app that I developed on my free time to help me check my gas mileage, as well as the price you paid for the gas and the distance I drove.

The app could use some more features, it only supporst the metric system (the imperial system is missing). Another issue is that in some file explorers it gives an exception when trying to export/import the settings.
